Credits To @stuartt on Rec Room for making this first. I instead made it in AutoHotKey and I am pretty sure this is faster.
# A Key to color converter that transfers data from rec room using HUD Elements to a script to press keys on your real life computer.
## Requirements 
[AutoHotKey 2.0](https://autohotkey.com/)

On lines 3&4 you need to change the x & y values so the script knows where the HUD element is on the screen. This is required. I recommend using the "Window Spy" app that gets automatically downloaded with AutoHotKey to find these coordnates.

While using, The Rec Room HUD element needs to be visible on your screen for the script to pick up the colors.
