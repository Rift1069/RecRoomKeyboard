Credits To @stuartt on Rec Room for making this first. I instead made it in AutoHotKey and I am pretty sure this is faster.
# A Working Keyboard In Rec Room! This works by using CV2 to send solid colors to a HUD Element that mean characters. Then, An AutoHotKey Script picks up the color and then presses the key accordingly.
For this to work you need to download [AutoHotKey 2.0 first.](https://autohotkey.com/)

# On lines 3&4 you need to change the x & y values so the script knows where the HUD element is on the screen. This is required. I recommend using the "Window Spy" app that gets automatically downloaded with AutoHotKey to find these coordnates.

# While using, The Rec Room HUD element needs to be visible on your screen for the script to pick up the colors.

If you use this at all in any rooms, videos, or make a diferent version of the code, please credit me. You don't have to, but it's greatly appreciated <3
