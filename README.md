A Working Keyboard In Rec Room! This works by using CV2 to send solid colors to a HUD Element that mean characters. Then, An AutoHotKey Script picks up the color and then presses the key accordingly.
For this to work you need to download AutoHotKey 2.0 first. (https://autohotkey.com/)

On lines 3&4 you need to change the x & y values so the script knows where the HUD element is on the screen. This is required. I recommend using the "Window Spy" app that gets automatically downloaded with AutoHotKey to find these coordnates.
